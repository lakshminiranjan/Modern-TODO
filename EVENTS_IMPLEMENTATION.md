# Events Table Implementation

## Problem
The application was trying to use an events table in Supabase, but the table didn't exist. This caused events to not be properly created and stored in the database.

## Solution
We implemented a comprehensive solution that:

1. Automatically creates the events table if it doesn't exist
2. Migrates any local events to the database
3. Provides a fallback to localStorage if the database is unavailable
4. Adds a manual table creation button in the UI

## Files Modified

### 1. lib/createEventsTable.ts (New)
- Created a new module to handle events table creation
- Implemented SQL to create the table with proper structure and RLS policies
- Added migration functionality to move localStorage events to the database

### 2. lib/supabase.ts
- Updated the `ensureEventsTableExists` function to create the table if it doesn't exist
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx
- Added UI to show when the events table doesn't exist
- Implemented a button to manually trigger table creation
- Improved error handling and logging

### 4. supabase/migrations/20240101000000_create_events_table.sql (New)
- Created a SQL migration file that can be run directly in Supabase
- Includes table creation and RLS policies
- Adds helper functions for table management

## How It Works

1. When the calendar screen loads, it checks if the events table exists
2. If the table doesn't exist, it attempts to create it automatically
3. If creation fails, it shows a UI with a button to manually create the table
4. Once the table exists, events are stored in the database instead of localStorage
5. The application maintains a real-time subscription to events changes

## Testing

A test file has been added at `tests/events-table.test.js` to verify the table creation works correctly.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation has been added in `README_EVENTS.md` explaining:
- The table structure
- How the automatic creation works
- The migration process
- Troubleshooting steps
- The fallback mechanism

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard to ensure the table exists
2. Test creating events to verify they are properly stored in the database
3. Check the real-time subscription to ensure events update automatically
