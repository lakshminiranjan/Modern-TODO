-- Completely disable RLS for the profiles table
-- This is a temporary measure to fix the immediate issue
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can do anything" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can read any profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON profiles;

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
GRANT ALL ON profiles TO anon, authenticated, service_role;

-- Note: RLS is now disabled for the profiles table
-- This means all users can read/write to the profiles table
-- This should be revisited in a future migration once the immediate issue is resolved
